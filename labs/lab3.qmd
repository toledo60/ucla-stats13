### Learning Objectives


Students will be able to:

- Increase skill and comfort with basic data management and syntax in R.
- Review and increase understanding of the basic methodology and syntax of the for loop 
- Simulating the sampling distributions for sample proportions and sample means.
- Review the concepts of the sampling distribution and the normal approximation.
- Practice constructing and interpreting confidence intervals.

### Required Data and Packages

We will use the data from the “College of the Midwest” used in Section 2.1 in the textbook *(Introduction to Statistical Investigations by Tintle et al.)*


```{r,eval=FALSE}
college <- read.table("http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data/chap3/CollegeMidwest.txt", 
                      header = TRUE)
```


Throughout the lab we will use the `mosaic` package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```

### Questions

<!---
#### Question 1

Set the seed to 8695 and take a simple random sample of size 30 from the `college` data frame. Save the random sample of `college` as a separate R object named `sample_0`, and print the first six rows to make sure you saved it correctly


We will treat `sample_0` as our observed sample data from the population dataset `college`

#### Question 2


Compute the population proportion and sample proportion of students who live on campus,
and assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values



#### Question 3

Create a bar graph that displays the *proportions* (or *relative frequency*) of students in your sample from Question 1 who live on campus or not

*Hint:* Use `?bargraph` to find the R documentation for the `bargraph()` function and find an argument that allows you to change the *type* of scale (on the *y-axis*).



#### Question 4

Create a histogram of the sampling distribution of sample proportions. Superimpose a normal
curve by including the argument `fit = "normal"`


#### Question 5

Compute the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of sample proportions
based on your simulation


#### Question 6


Visualize the population distribution and the sample distribution of the cumulative GPA for
students at the College of the Midwest. Describe the distributions

*Hint:* Is the cumulative GPA variable quantitative or categorical?


#### Question 7

Compute the population mean and sample mean of students’ cumulative GPAs, and assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values

#### Question 8

Compute the population standard deviation and sample standard deviation of students’ 
cumulative GPAs, and assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values


#### Question 9

Set the seed to 6924 and simulate the sampling distribution of the mean cumulative GPA for the students at the College of the Midwest. Simulate the sample means with 1000 random samples of size 30. Provide the code that you use to accomplish this.

#### Question 10

Create a histogram of the sampling distribution of sample means. Superimpose a normal curve by including the argument `fit = "normal"`



#### Question 11

Compute the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of sample means based on your simulation

#### Question 12


Do you think the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal? Be
sure to comment on the relevant validity condition(s) and the histogram in Question 4

*Hint:* Try adjusting the number of histogram bins using the nint argument in the `histogram()` function.



#### Question 13

According to the theory-based method (i.e., normal approximation by invoking the Central Limit Theorem), what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample proportions? How close are these values to your simulation-based values from Question 5?


#### Question 14

Report and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who live on
campus using the theory-based approach. Does this interval contain the population parameter?


#### Question 15

Do you think the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal? Be sure to comment on the relevant validity condition(s) and the histogram in Question 10.


#### Question 16

According to the theory-based method (i.e., normal approximation by invoking the Central Limit Theorem), what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means? How close are these values to your simulation-based values from Question 11?


#### Question 17

Report and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the cumulative GPA of students using the theory-based approach. The appropriate multiplier can be obtained by running `qt(0.975, df = 29)`. Does this interval contain the population parameter?
