- Make and interpret boxplots
- Simulate the null distribution for the difference in two sample means
- Analyze data consisting of a quantitative explanatory variable and a quantitative response variable
- Make and interpret scatterplots
- Carry out an entire test of significance for correlation using simulations and theory

### Required Data and Packages

We will use the following data in this lab

1. The file `"bodytemp.csv"` on CCLE has data from a study done by Philip A. Mackowiak, MD et al. in 1992 [(Mackowiak, et. al, JAMA. 1992;268(12):1578-1580)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/400116)

Throughout the lab we will use the `mosaic` package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```
