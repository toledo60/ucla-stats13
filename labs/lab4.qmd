### Learning Objectives

- Increase skill and comfort with basic data management and syntax in R.
- Review the concepts of the normal distribution.
- Review standardized statistics and introduce $z$-scores.
- Compute probabilities from the normal distribution and the $t$-distribution.
- Review the concepts of the $t$-distribution and the one sample $t$-test.
- Carry out an entire test of significance for the difference in two proportions using
simulations and theory

### Required Data and Packages

We will use two data sets in this lab

1. We will use the data from the “College of the Midwest” used in Section 2.1 in the textbook *(Introduction to Statistical Investigations by Tintle et al.)*


```{r,eval=FALSE}
college <- read.table("http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data/chap3/CollegeMidwest.txt", 
                      header = TRUE)
```


2. The file “cdc.csv” on CCLE contains data based on a random sample conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


Throughout the lab we will use the `mosaic` package

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
```
