[Logical Statements and Applications](/notes/06-logical-statements.qmd)\n2. [Introduction to for-loops](/notes/07-for-loops.qmd)\n3. [Sampling and Simulation](/notes/08-sampling_simulation.qmd)\n\n---\n\n### Required Data and Packages\n\nWe will continue to work with the NC data on births used in Lab 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirths <- read.csv('your path to births.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThroughout the lab we will use the `mosaic` package\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic)\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Questions\n\n#### Question 1\n\nWhat are the names of the variables that indicate whether or not the mother smoked and the weight of the baby?\n\n\n#### Question 2\n\nIn addition to the variable that indicates whether or not the mother smoked, choose one numerical (quantitative) variable and one categorical variable that you think might also affect the weight of a baby. Explain why\n\n\n\n#### Question 3\n\nCreate a data frame that has only the variables `Gender, Premie, weight`, and `Apgar1`, and the observations for which the baby was not premature. Print out the first few rows using the `head()` function.\n\n\n#### Question 4\n\nCreate a data frame that has only the four variables you identified in Questions 1 and 2 and the observations for which the mother was a smoker. Print out the first few rows using the `head()` function\n\n\n\n#### Question 5\n\nReport the mean of\n\n(a) the weights of all babies.\n(b) the weights of those born to smoking mothers.\n(c) the weights of those born to non-smoking mothers.\n\nThe `sd()` function computes the standard deviation of the input. The syntax is identical to that of the `mean()` function\n\n#### Question 6\n\nReport the standard deviation of\n\n(a) the weights of all babies\n(b) the weights of those born to smoking mothers\n(c) the weights of those born to non-smoking mothers\n\n\n#### Question 7\n\nUsing `Births`, create two graphics that help answer this question: Does the birth weight of babies born to smoking mothers differ from those born to non-smoking mothers?\n\n*Note:* You are not limited to histograms. If you want, you can look into `dotPlot(), densityplot(), freqpolygon(), bwplot()`, and `mosaicplot()` for other types of plots to visualize data\n\n\n#### Question 8\n\nSet the seed to 2023 and simulate tossing 19 coins, where the probability of heads is 0.3 using `rflip()`. Print the first six lines of the output\n\n\n#### Question 9\n\nSet the seed to 2023 and simulate 1000 repetitions of tossing 19 coins,where the probability of heads is 0.3. Save the output from this simulation, and print the first six lines from the saved data frame\n\n#### Question 10\n\nSetup your own coin flip simulation. Pick your own seed, sample size, number  of repetitions and probability. Print the first six lines of the output.\n\n\n#### Question 11\n\nSet the seed to 2350 and choose 25 numbers out of the numbers from 1to 1990, without replacement.\n\n\n#### Question 12\n\nSet the seed to 2350 and simulate 25 coin flips using the `sample()` function, where the probability of heads (represented by 1) is 0.3. Print the proportion of heads obtained\n\n*Hint:* What would the `mean()` function do given the vector of coded coin flips?\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n",
