[Sampling and Simulation](/notes/08-sampling_simulation.qmd)\n2. [Normal Distribution](/notes/09-normal_distribution.qmd)\n3. [Introduction to Central Limit Theorem](/notes/10-CLT.qmd)\n\n---\n\n### Required Data and Packages\n\nWe will use the data from the “College of the Midwest” used in Section 2.1 in the textbook *(Introduction to Statistical Investigations by Tintle et al.)*\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncollege <- read.table(\"http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data/chap3/CollegeMidwest.txt\", \n                      header = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThroughout the lab we will use the `mosaic` package\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic)\n```\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n### Questions\n\n\n#### Question 1\n\nSet the seed to 8695 and take a simple random sample of size 30 from the `college` data frame. Save the random sample of `college` as a separate R object named `sample_0`, and print the first six rows to make sure you saved it correctly\n\n\nWe will treat `sample_0` as our observed sample data from the population dataset `college`\n\n#### Question 2\n\n\nCompute the population proportion and sample proportion of students who live on campus,\nand assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values\n\n\n\n#### Question 3\n\nCreate a bar graph that displays the *proportions* (or *relative frequency*) of students in your sample from Question 1 who live on campus or not\n\n*Hint:* Use `?bargraph` to find the R documentation for the `bargraph()` function and find an argument that allows you to change the *type* of scale (on the *y-axis*).\n\n\n\n#### Question 4\n\nCreate a histogram of the sampling distribution of sample proportions. Superimpose a normal\ncurve by including the argument `fit = \"normal\"`\n\n\n#### Question 5\n\nCompute the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of sample proportions\nbased on your simulation\n\n\n#### Question 6\n\n\nVisualize the population distribution and the sample distribution of the cumulative GPA for\nstudents at the College of the Midwest. Describe the distributions\n\n*Hint:* Is the cumulative GPA variable quantitative or categorical?\n\n\n#### Question 7\n\nCompute the population mean and sample mean of students’ cumulative GPAs, and assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values\n\n#### Question 8\n\nCompute the population standard deviation and sample standard deviation of students’ \ncumulative GPAs, and assign the appropriate symbol to each of the values\n\n\n#### Question 9\n\nSet the seed to 6924 and simulate the sampling distribution of the mean cumulative GPA for the students at the College of the Midwest. Simulate the sample means with 1000 random samples of size 30. Provide the code that you use to accomplish this.\n\n#### Question 10\n\nCreate a histogram of the sampling distribution of sample means. Superimpose a normal curve by including the argument `fit = \"normal\"`\n\n\n\n#### Question 11\n\nCompute the mean and standard error of the sampling distribution of sample means based on your simulation\n\n#### Question 12\n\n\nDo you think the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal? Be\nsure to comment on the relevant validity condition(s) and the histogram in Question 4\n\n*Hint:* Try adjusting the number of histogram bins using the nint argument in the `histogram()` function.\n\n\n\n#### Question 13\n\nAccording to the theory-based method (i.e., normal approximation by invoking the Central Limit Theorem), what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample proportions? How close are these values to your simulation-based values from Question 5?\n\n\n#### Question 14\n\nReport and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of students who live on\ncampus using the theory-based approach. Does this interval contain the population parameter?\n\n\n#### Question 15\n\nDo you think the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal? Be sure to comment on the relevant validity condition(s) and the histogram in Question 10.\n\n\n#### Question 16\n\nAccording to the theory-based method (i.e., normal approximation by invoking the Central Limit Theorem), what is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means? How close are these values to your simulation-based values from Question 11?\n\n\n#### Question 17\n\nReport and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the cumulative GPA of students using the theory-based approach. The appropriate multiplier can be obtained by running `qt(0.975, df = 29)`. Does this interval contain the population parameter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
