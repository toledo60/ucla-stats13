In R, we can abbreviate `TRUE` with `T` and `FALSE` with `F`. They can be interpreted as any option corresponding to a binary choice. For example, yes/no, do/don't, satisfied/not satisfied or even `1/0`.\n\nA basic way to define a logical statement is using a **relational operator** to compare two expressions. For example, we may ask ourselves *\"is x less than a certain number ?\"* or using a real world example from the `mtcars` dataset *\"how many cars have more than 18 miles per gallon?\"*\n\n### Relational operators\n\nThe table below summarizes some of the **relational operators** available in R:\n\n| Operator | Interpretation           | Basic Example | Result  |\n|----------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| ==       | Equal to                 | 5 == 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| !=       | Not equal to             | 4 != 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| \\>       | Greater than             | 4 \\> 5        | `FALSE` |\n| \\<       | Less than                | 4 \\< 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| \\<=      | Less than or equal to    | 4 \\<= 5       | `TRUE`  |\n| \\>=      | Greater than or equal to | 4 \\>= 5       | `FALSE` |\n\nFrom the table above we consider single numbers as our two expression to compare, but we can extend this idea to vectors, data.frames, matrices of various data types. When applying relational operators to vectors it is important to know they are being compared *element-wise*.\n\nWe first start off by comparing a vector with a single number\n\n```{r}\nc(1,3,5,7,9) < 5\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than 5? is 3 less than 5? is 5 less than 5? is 7 less than 5? is 9 less than 5?*\n\nThe output from the above example is a `logical` vector\n\n```{r}\nclass(c(1,3,5,7,9) < 5)\n```\n\nwith `TRUE/FALSE` if the given condition was satisfied or not. What if we were given the question *\"How many values of x are smaller than some number?\"*\n\n```{r}\nsum( c(1,3,5,7,9) < 5 )\n```\n\nwe can then apply the `sum()` function to count how many `TRUE` were in our logical vector. This will be very useful when we have very large vectors and we can't count how many `TRUE` were in our vector manually.\n\nBelow are some examples applying relational operators to compare two vectors of the same length\n\n```{r}\nc(1,2,3,4) < c(5,4,3,2)\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than 5? is 2 less than 4? is 3 less than 3? is 4 less than 2?*\n\n```{r}\nc(1,2,3,4) <= c(5,4,3,2)\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than or equal to 5? is 2 less than or equal to 4? is 3 less than or equal to 3? is 4 less than or equal to 2?*\n\n\nAnother topic to consider is comparing two strings. While this can be a more advance topic we only consider the simplest scenario in which we compare case-sensitive strings.\n\n```{r}\nstring1 <- 'Hello'\nstring2 <- 'hello'\n```\n\nwhile the above strings contain the same characters in the same order, if we compare them directly they will be considered different \n\n```{r}\nstring1 == string2\n```\n*Interpretation: are string1 and string2 identical?*\n\nHowever, if were are interested in seeing if they contain the same characters regardless of the case sensitivity, we can use `tolower()` function as follows\n\n```{r}\ntolower(string1)\ntolower(string2)\n```\n\n`tolower()` will convert any upper-case character in a vector into lower-case character.\n\n\n```{r}\ntolower(string1) == tolower(string2)\n```\n\nSince all the characters are now lower-case, and both strings contain the same characters in the same order then they are now identical.\n\nFor more advanced examples in comparing strings check out the following [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/how-to-compare-strings-in-r-with-examples/) *(Optional)*\n\n\n### Logical operators\n\nIn practice, we often need to use multiple conditions to make certain decisions. For example, you have a personal rule that if there is no homework *AND* you don't have class, then you will go out with your friends. Now, explore what happens to this rule when *OR* is used instead of *AND*, also what happens when negation (*NOT* ) is added to one or both clauses.\n\nThe table below summarizes some of these logical operators\n\n+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Operator      | Interpretation                                                                           | Basic Example         | Result                |\n+:=============:+==========================================================================================+=======================+=======================+\n| !             | **NOT** <br> *If the condition is true,* <br>*logical NOT operator returns as false*     | !

Whereas, *single comparison* only compares the first two elements of the logical vectors and will return a single logical value\n\n\n```{r}\nage <- 20\nage == 18 || age <= 21\n```\n*Interpretation: Is age 18 OR less than or equal to 21 ?*\n\n\n```{r}\nage > 10 && age < 30\n```\n*Interpretation: Is age greater than AND less than 30?*\n\n\nConsider a more complicated example of holding office in the United States.\nThe president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_age <- 40\ncandidate_birth <- 'United States'\ncandidate_residance_years <- 10\n```\n\nWe have a candidate who is 40 years old, was born in the United States but for some reason they have only been a resident of the United States for 10 years. Clearly, this candidate is not eligible to become our next president. We demonstrate this using logical operators\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_age >= 35\n```\n*Interpretation: Is the candidate at least 35 years old?*\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_birth == 'United States'\n```\n*Interpretation: Is the candidate born in United States?*\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_residance_years >= 14\n```\n*Interpretation: Has the candidate been a resident for at least 14 years?*\n\nPutting all of the above together,\n\n```{r}\n(candidate_age >= 35) && (candidate_birth == 'United States') && (candidate_residance_years >= 14)\n```\n*Interpretation: TRUE AND TRUE AND FALSE*\n\nSince one of the conditions fails the entire statement will be false.\n\n## Subsetting\n\n### Vectors\n\nNow that we have an idea of how to construct logical statements, we can apply them to subset our data based on a given condition\n\nConsider the following vector `dat` with 18 values\n\n```{r}\ndat <- c(11, 13, 18, 3, 2, 24, 10, 8, 5, \n         13, 3, 23, 7, 25, 17, 20, 11, 17)\n```\n\nWe will subset `dat` based on the following conditions:\n\n**1.  How many values are bigger than 10?**\n\n```{r}\ndat > 10 \nsum(dat > 10 )\n```\n\nwhile knowing how many values are bigger than 10 is useful, we may only want to keep those values and not the ones that are smaller than 10.\n\n**2.  Keep the values that are bigger than 10?**\n\nIf given a vector, the way to subset it based on a condition is as follows: <br> `vector[ condtion ]`. Our condition is all the values that are bigger than 10, that is `dat > 10`\n\n```{r}\ndat[ dat > 10 ]\n```\n\n**3. How many values are exactly 11 ?**\n\nOur condition is `dat == 11`,this should only return two `TRUE`, and after using the `sum()` function to count them we obtain\n\n```{r}\nsum(dat == 11)\n```\n\nIf we wanted to extract these values from `dat` we would run\n\n```{r}\ndat[ dat == 11 ]\n```\n\n\nNext we use the `birth` dataset for the following examples\n\n**4. How many females were in this dataset?**\n\n```{r}\nbirth_dat <- read.csv(file = \"/Users/toledo60/Desktop/Projects/personal-website/data/births.csv\")\n```\n\nFirst we extract the values from the `Gender` column and store them in a variable called `gender_vec`\n\n```{r}\ngender_vec <- birth_dat$Gender\n```\n\n```{r}\nunique(gender_vec)\n```\n\n:::callout-warning\nRecall strings are case-sensitive, so you must spell 'Female' exactly as it appears above\n:::\n\nThen we subset this vector to only include females\n\n```{r}\nfemales_vec <- gender_vec[gender_vec == 'Female']\n```\n\n```{r}\nunique(females_vec)\n```\n\nNow our vector only contains females, we can use `length()` to count how many females were in this dataset\n\n```{r}\nlength(females_vec)\n```\n\nAn easier approach would be to simply create the variable `gender_vec` and count how many females are in that vector\n\n```{r}\nsum(gender_vec == 'Female')\n```\n\n\n### Data Frames\n\nConsidering *example 4* in the [vectors](#vectors) section of subsetting, we are extracting solely the values from a specific column based on a given condition. However, in some scenarios we may want to preserve all other information *(columns)* from our dataset after subsetting our data.\n\nData frames have the following structure `data[rows,columns]`. The first \nargument inside the brackets will specify the rows and the second argument will specify the columns. We can apply all of the subsetting techniques we covered in the [vectors](#section) within the rows, columns, or both rows and columns\n`data[condition for rows, condition for columns]`\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to subset the `births` dataset to only include females\n\n```{r}\nis_female <- birth_dat$Gender == 'Female'\n```\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nbirth_dat[is_female, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Subset the rows to only include females, keep all the other columns*\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nhead(birth_dat[is_female,],3)\n```\n\nYou will notice that we only applied a condition to the rows argument and not the columns argument. In the case where one of the arguments is left blank, then no condition will be applied to the respective argument.\n\nFor practice, consider the following examples\n\n**1. Create a new data frame containing the columns: Gender, weight, and Habit**\n\nWe can use `colnames()`\n\n```{r}\ncolnames(birth_dat)\n```\n\nto make sure we have the correct spelling of the appropriate columns we want to keep. \n\n\n```{r}\nbirth2 <- birth_dat[ , c('Gender','weight','Habit')]\n```\n*Interpretation: Keep all the rows, but only keep the columns: Gender, weight, and Habit*\n\n\n```{r}\nhead(birth2,3)\n```\n\nWe created a character vector with the names of the columns we wanted to keep and used it as the condition in the columns argument.\n\n\n\n**2. Split `birth_dat` into two parts: One for which the individual was a smoker and another for which they were not a smoker**\n\nThe variable `Habit` contains information on whether or not the individual was a smoker.\n\n```{r}\nunique(birth_dat$Habit)\n```\n\nFirst we create a logical vector to determine if the individual was a smoker \n\n```{r}\nis_smoker <- birth_dat$Habit == 'Smoker'\n```\n\n```{r}\nis_smoker[1:5]\n```\n*Interpretation: Return TRUE if Habit is smoker, otherwise FALSE*\n\nWe use the negation [logical operator](#logical-operators) to obtain all the non-smokers from our logical vector `is_smoker` without having to create a new variable\n\n```{r}\n!is_smoker[1:5]\n```\n\nTo subset our data into keeping only the smokers we input our logical vector `is_smoker` into the rows argument\n\n```{r}\nsmokers <- birth_dat[is_smoker, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the rows in which the individual is a smoker*\n\n```{r}\nhead(smokers,3)\n```\n\nTo subset our data into keeping only the non-smokers we input our logical vector `!is_smoker` into the rows argument\n\n```{r}\nnot_smokers <- birth_dat[!is_smoker, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the rows in which the individual is NOT a smoker*\n\n```{r}\nhead(not_smokers,3)\n```\n\n\n**3. What is the average weight of babies with at least one birth defect?**\n\nThe variable `BirthDef` determines if the baby had no birth defects or had at least one defect\n\n```{r}\nunique(birth_dat$BirthDef)\n```\n\nCreate a logical vector to determine if the baby had at least one defect\n\n```{r}\nhas_defect <- (birth_dat$BirthDef == 'At Least One')\n```\n\n:::callout-note\nWe must spell \"At Least One\" with correct upper/lower cases including spaces\n:::\n\n```{r}\nhas_defect[1:5]\n```\n\nSubset our data to include rows with babies with at least one defect, then select only the `weight` column. Lastly compute the mean.\n\n```{r}\nmean( birth_dat[has_defect,'weight'] )\n```\n*Interpretation: Average weight of babies with at least one birth defect*\n\n\n## Missing Data\n\nMissing data (or missing values) appear when no value is available in one or more variables of an observation. A common example can look something like this \n\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nstudent_dat <- data.frame(\n  'StudentID' = c('12345', '23456', '23405'),\n  'Major' = c(\"math\",NA,\"biology\"),\n  'GPA' = c(3.8,3.2,NA))\n\nknitr::kable(student_dat)\n```\n\nwhere we do not know the major of the second student and we also do not know the major from the third student *(denoted by `NA`)*\n\n\nIdentifying the rows and columns where missing values occur is necessary before addressing the issue of missingness. Although it is easy to observe in the example mentioned above, in most cases, dealing with larger datasets requires a more programmatic approach\n\n\n### Vectors\n\nIn R, `NA` stands for \"Not Available\" and is used to represent missing values in a dataset. \n`NA` can be used for any data type in R, such as numeric character, or logical.\n\nThe type of `NA` is a logical value\n\n```{r}\ntypeof(NA)\n```\n\nand can be coerced into any other data type. For example, consider the following numeric vector \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(1,2,3))\n```\n\nbut now with a missing value as the third element, it will preserve the original data type \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(1,2,NA,4))\n```\n\nor even a character vector \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(\"a\",\"b\",NA,\"c\"))\n```\n\nIn the following, we will show several examples how to find missing values. The most common approach is to use the function `is.na()`\n\n\n```{r}\nis.na(c(1,2,NA,4,NA))\n```\n*Interpretation: For each element does this element contain `NA`*\n\n\n\nwhich will return a logical vector of the same length as the input vector, `TRUE` in the \nposition which `NA` is located in. We can use the function `which()` in order to find out the actual position of `TRUE` \n\n```{r}\nwhich( is.na(c(1,2,NA,4,NA)) )\n```\n*Interpretation: Which position(s) are the logical values `TRUE` located*\n\n\nThe output will then be an integer vector denoting the positions in which there were missing values. Applying the concepts learned in **Subsetting**, we can exclude any values which are missing. For example,\n\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1,2,NA,4,NA)\nis.na(x)\n```\n\n```{r}\n!is.na(x)\n```\n*Interpretation: For each element does this element NOT contain `NA`*\n\n```{r}\nx[!is.na(x)]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the elements which DO NOT contain `NA`*\n\nIf we only want to find out if there any `NA` values, we can utilize the function `anyNA()`\n\n```{r}\nanyNA(c(1,2,NA,4,NA))\n```\n\nThe above command will output `TRUE` if there are any `NA` in the vector and `FALSE` if there is not a single missing value\n\n```{r}\nanyNA(c(1,2,3))\n```\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, a common approach to check for missing data in R, we can use `is.na()` or `anyNA()`. If we want to know the position of the missing values, we should use `is.na()`. However, if we are only concerned with whether there are any missing values or not, and not their position, then we can use `anyNA()`\n\n\n\n### Data Frames\n\nNow, working with data frames we would like to verify if there are any missing observations \nthroughout the entire dataset\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nstudent_dat <- data.frame(\n  'StudentID' = c('12345', '23456', '23405'),\n  'Major' = c(\"math\",NA,\"biology\"),\n  'GPA' = c(3.8,3.2,NA))\n```\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nstudent_dat\n```\n\n\nWhen the function `is.na()` is applied to a data frame, the output will be a matrix containing logical values. The logical values in the matrix will depend on whether there were any missing values or not in the data frame\n\n```{r}\nis.na(student_dat)\n```\n\n\nIf we wanted to find out the position(s) of the missing values for each column we will utilize the `apply()`. The basic syntax for `apply()` is \n\n`apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)`\n\n- `x`: an array or matrix\n\n- `MARGIN`:  take a value or range between 1 and 2 to define where to apply the function\n\n- `MARGIN=1`: the manipulation is performed on rows\n\n- `MARGIN=2`: the manipulation is performed on columns\n\n- `MARGIN=c(1,2)`: the manipulation is performed on rows and columns\n\n- `FUN`: tells which function to apply, according to the specified `MARGIN`\n\n\n```{r}\napply(X = is.na(student_dat), MARGIN = 2, FUN = which)\n```\n*Interpretation: From each column `MARGIN =2`, which values `(FUN = which)` from student_dat are missing `is.na(student_dat)`*\n\n\nThe output of using `apply(...,MARGIN =2)` will be a list containing the row(s) in which missing values were found from each `column`. \n\nIn our case there were no rows with missing data in the first column, the second row contained a missing value from the column *Major* and the third row contained a missing value from the column *GPA*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include = FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  comment = \"#>\",\n  fig.width = 6,\n  fig.height = 4,\n  eval = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n---\n \n## Logical Statements\n\nThere are only two logical values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`. In R, we can abbreviate `TRUE` with `T` and `FALSE` with `F`. They can be interpreted as any option corresponding to a binary choice. For example, yes/no, do/don't, satisfied/not satisfied or even `1/0`.\n\nA basic way to define a logical statement is using a **relational operator** to compare two expressions. For example, we may ask ourselves *\"is x less than a certain number ?\"* or using a real world example from the `mtcars` dataset *\"how many cars have more than 18 miles per gallon?\"*\n\n### Relational operators\n\nThe table below summarizes some of the **relational operators** available in R:\n\n| Operator | Interpretation           | Basic Example | Result  |\n|----------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| ==       | Equal to                 | 5 == 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| !=       | Not equal to             | 4 != 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| \\>       | Greater than             | 4 \\> 5        | `FALSE` |\n| \\<       | Less than                | 4 \\< 5        | `TRUE`  |\n| \\<=      | Less than or equal to    | 4 \\<= 5       | `TRUE`  |\n| \\>=      | Greater than or equal to | 4 \\>= 5       | `FALSE` |\n\nFrom the table above we consider single numbers as our two expression to compare, but we can extend this idea to vectors, data.frames, matrices of various data types. When applying relational operators to vectors it is important to know they are being compared *element-wise*.\n\nWe first start off by comparing a vector with a single number\n\n```{r}\nc(1,3,5,7,9) < 5\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than 5? is 3 less than 5? is 5 less than 5? is 7 less than 5? is 9 less than 5?*\n\nThe output from the above example is a `logical` vector\n\n```{r}\nclass(c(1,3,5,7,9) < 5)\n```\n\nwith `TRUE/FALSE` if the given condition was satisfied or not. What if we were given the question *\"How many values of x are smaller than some number?\"*\n\n```{r}\nsum( c(1,3,5,7,9) < 5 )\n```\n\nwe can then apply the `sum()` function to count how many `TRUE` were in our logical vector. This will be very useful when we have very large vectors and we can't count how many `TRUE` were in our vector manually.\n\nBelow are some examples applying relational operators to compare two vectors of the same length\n\n```{r}\nc(1,2,3,4) < c(5,4,3,2)\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than 5? is 2 less than 4? is 3 less than 3? is 4 less than 2?*\n\n```{r}\nc(1,2,3,4) <= c(5,4,3,2)\n```\n\n*Interpretation: Is 1 less than or equal to 5? is 2 less than or equal to 4? is 3 less than or equal to 3? is 4 less than or equal to 2?*\n\n\nAnother topic to consider is comparing two strings. While this can be a more advance topic we only consider the simplest scenario in which we compare case-sensitive strings.\n\n```{r}\nstring1 <- 'Hello'\nstring2 <- 'hello'\n```\n\nwhile the above strings contain the same characters in the same order, if we compare them directly they will be considered different \n\n```{r}\nstring1 == string2\n```\n*Interpretation: are string1 and string2 identical?*\n\nHowever, if were are interested in seeing if they contain the same characters regardless of the case sensitivity, we can use `tolower()` function as follows\n\n```{r}\ntolower(string1)\ntolower(string2)\n```\n\n`tolower()` will convert any upper-case character in a vector into lower-case character.\n\n\n```{r}\ntolower(string1) == tolower(string2)\n```\n\nSince all the characters are now lower-case, and both strings contain the same characters in the same order then they are now identical.\n\nFor more advanced examples in comparing strings check out the following [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/how-to-compare-strings-in-r-with-examples/) *(Optional)*\n\n\n### Logical operators\n\nIn practice, we often need to use multiple conditions to make certain decisions. For example, you have a personal rule that if there is no homework *AND* you don't have class, then you will go out with your friends. Now, explore what happens to this rule when *OR* is used instead of *AND*, also what happens when negation (*NOT* ) is added to one or both clauses.\n\nThe table below summarizes some of these logical operators\n\n+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\n| Operator      | Interpretation                                                                           | Basic Example         | Result                |\n+:=============:+==========================================================================================+=======================+=======================+\n| !             | **NOT** <br> *If the condition is true,* <br>*logical NOT operator returns as false*     | !

Whereas, *single comparison* only compares the first two elements of the logical vectors and will return a single logical value\n\n\n```{r}\nage <- 20\nage == 18 || age <= 21\n```\n*Interpretation: Is age 18 OR less than or equal to 21 ?*\n\n\n```{r}\nage > 10 && age < 30\n```\n*Interpretation: Is age greater than AND less than 30?*\n\n\nConsider a more complicated example of holding office in the United States.\nThe president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a resident of the United States for 14 years\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_age <- 40\ncandidate_birth <- 'United States'\ncandidate_residance_years <- 10\n```\n\nWe have a candidate who is 40 years old, was born in the United States but for some reason they have only been a resident of the United States for 10 years. Clearly, this candidate is not eligible to become our next president. We demonstrate this using logical operators\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_age >= 35\n```\n*Interpretation: Is the candidate at least 35 years old?*\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_birth == 'United States'\n```\n*Interpretation: Is the candidate born in United States?*\n\n```{r}\ncandidate_residance_years >= 14\n```\n*Interpretation: Has the candidate been a resident for at least 14 years?*\n\nPutting all of the above together,\n\n```{r}\n(candidate_age >= 35) && (candidate_birth == 'United States') && (candidate_residance_years >= 14)\n```\n*Interpretation: TRUE AND TRUE AND FALSE*\n\nSince one of the conditions fails the entire statement will be false.\n\n## Subsetting\n\n### Vectors\n\nNow that we have an idea of how to construct logical statements, we can apply them to subset our data based on a given condition\n\nConsider the following vector `dat` with 18 values\n\n```{r}\ndat <- c(11, 13, 18, 3, 2, 24, 10, 8, 5, \n         13, 3, 23, 7, 25, 17, 20, 11, 17)\n```\n\nWe will subset `dat` based on the following conditions:\n\n**1.  How many values are bigger than 10?**\n\n```{r}\ndat > 10 \nsum(dat > 10 )\n```\n\nwhile knowing how many values are bigger than 10 is useful, we may only want to keep those values and not the ones that are smaller than 10.\n\n**2.  Keep the values that are bigger than 10?**\n\nIf given a vector, the way to subset it based on a condition is as follows: <br> `vector[ condtion ]`. Our condition is all the values that are bigger than 10, that is `dat > 10`\n\n```{r}\ndat[ dat > 10 ]\n```\n\n**3. How many values are exactly 11 ?**\n\nOur condition is `dat == 11`,this should only return two `TRUE`, and after using the `sum()` function to count them we obtain\n\n```{r}\nsum(dat == 11)\n```\n\nIf we wanted to extract these values from `dat` we would run\n\n```{r}\ndat[ dat == 11 ]\n```\n\n\nNext we use the `birth` dataset for the following examples\n\n**4. How many females were in this dataset?**\n\n```{r}\nbirth_dat <- read.csv(file = \"/Users/toledo60/Desktop/Projects/personal-website/data/births.csv\")\n```\n\nFirst we extract the values from the `Gender` column and store them in a variable called `gender_vec`\n\n```{r}\ngender_vec <- birth_dat$Gender\n```\n\n```{r}\nunique(gender_vec)\n```\n\n:::callout-warning\nRecall strings are case-sensitive, so you must spell 'Female' exactly as it appears above\n:::\n\nThen we subset this vector to only include females\n\n```{r}\nfemales_vec <- gender_vec[gender_vec == 'Female']\n```\n\n```{r}\nunique(females_vec)\n```\n\nNow our vector only contains females, we can use `length()` to count how many females were in this dataset\n\n```{r}\nlength(females_vec)\n```\n\nAn easier approach would be to simply create the variable `gender_vec` and count how many females are in that vector\n\n```{r}\nsum(gender_vec == 'Female')\n```\n\n\n### Data Frames\n\nConsidering *example 4* in the [vectors](#vectors) section of subsetting, we are extracting solely the values from a specific column based on a given condition. However, in some scenarios we may want to preserve all other information *(columns)* from our dataset after subsetting our data.\n\nData frames have the following structure `data[rows,columns]`. The first \nargument inside the brackets will specify the rows and the second argument will specify the columns. We can apply all of the subsetting techniques we covered in the [vectors](#section) within the rows, columns, or both rows and columns\n`data[condition for rows, condition for columns]`\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to subset the `births` dataset to only include females\n\n```{r}\nis_female <- birth_dat$Gender == 'Female'\n```\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nbirth_dat[is_female, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Subset the rows to only include females, keep all the other columns*\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nhead(birth_dat[is_female,],3)\n```\n\nYou will notice that we only applied a condition to the rows argument and not the columns argument. In the case where one of the arguments is left blank, then no condition will be applied to the respective argument.\n\nFor practice, consider the following examples\n\n**1. Create a new data frame containing the columns: Gender, weight, and Habit**\n\nWe can use `colnames()`\n\n```{r}\ncolnames(birth_dat)\n```\n\nto make sure we have the correct spelling of the appropriate columns we want to keep. \n\n\n```{r}\nbirth2 <- birth_dat[ , c('Gender','weight','Habit')]\n```\n*Interpretation: Keep all the rows, but only keep the columns: Gender, weight, and Habit*\n\n\n```{r}\nhead(birth2,3)\n```\n\nWe created a character vector with the names of the columns we wanted to keep and used it as the condition in the columns argument.\n\n\n\n**2. Split `birth_dat` into two parts: One for which the individual was a smoker and another for which they were not a smoker**\n\nThe variable `Habit` contains information on whether or not the individual was a smoker.\n\n```{r}\nunique(birth_dat$Habit)\n```\n\nFirst we create a logical vector to determine if the individual was a smoker \n\n```{r}\nis_smoker <- birth_dat$Habit == 'Smoker'\n```\n\n```{r}\nis_smoker[1:5]\n```\n*Interpretation: Return TRUE if Habit is smoker, otherwise FALSE*\n\nWe use the negation [logical operator](#logical-operators) to obtain all the non-smokers from our logical vector `is_smoker` without having to create a new variable\n\n```{r}\n!is_smoker[1:5]\n```\n\nTo subset our data into keeping only the smokers we input our logical vector `is_smoker` into the rows argument\n\n```{r}\nsmokers <- birth_dat[is_smoker, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the rows in which the individual is a smoker*\n\n```{r}\nhead(smokers,3)\n```\n\nTo subset our data into keeping only the non-smokers we input our logical vector `!is_smoker` into the rows argument\n\n```{r}\nnot_smokers <- birth_dat[!is_smoker, ]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the rows in which the individual is NOT a smoker*\n\n```{r}\nhead(not_smokers,3)\n```\n\n\n**3. What is the average weight of babies with at least one birth defect?**\n\nThe variable `BirthDef` determines if the baby had no birth defects or had at least one defect\n\n```{r}\nunique(birth_dat$BirthDef)\n```\n\nCreate a logical vector to determine if the baby had at least one defect\n\n```{r}\nhas_defect <- (birth_dat$BirthDef == 'At Least One')\n```\n\n:::callout-note\nWe must spell \"At Least One\" with correct upper/lower cases including spaces\n:::\n\n```{r}\nhas_defect[1:5]\n```\n\nSubset our data to include rows with babies with at least one defect, then select only the `weight` column. Lastly compute the mean.\n\n```{r}\nmean( birth_dat[has_defect,'weight'] )\n```\n*Interpretation: Average weight of babies with at least one birth defect*\n\n\n## Missing Data\n\nMissing data (or missing values) appear when no value is available in one or more variables of an observation. A common example can look something like this \n\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nstudent_dat <- data.frame(\n  'StudentID' = c('12345', '23456', '23405'),\n  'Major' = c(\"math\",NA,\"biology\"),\n  'GPA' = c(3.8,3.2,NA))\n\nknitr::kable(student_dat)\n```\n\nwhere we do not know the major of the second student and we also do not know the major from the third student *(denoted by `NA`)*\n\n\nIdentifying the rows and columns where missing values occur is necessary before addressing the issue of missingness. Although it is easy to observe in the example mentioned above, in most cases, dealing with larger datasets requires a more programmatic approach\n\n\n### Vectors\n\nIn R, `NA` stands for \"Not Available\" and is used to represent missing values in a dataset. \n`NA` can be used for any data type in R, such as numeric character, or logical.\n\nThe type of `NA` is a logical value\n\n```{r}\ntypeof(NA)\n```\n\nand can be coerced into any other data type. For example, consider the following numeric vector \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(1,2,3))\n```\n\nbut now with a missing value as the third element, it will preserve the original data type \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(1,2,NA,4))\n```\n\nor even a character vector \n\n```{r}\ntypeof(c(\"a\",\"b\",NA,\"c\"))\n```\n\nIn the following, we will show several examples how to find missing values. The most common approach is to use the function `is.na()`\n\n\n```{r}\nis.na(c(1,2,NA,4,NA))\n```\n*Interpretation: For each element does this element contain `NA`*\n\n\n\nwhich will return a logical vector of the same length as the input vector, `TRUE` in the \nposition which `NA` is located in. We can use the function `which()` in order to find out the actual position of `TRUE` \n\n```{r}\nwhich( is.na(c(1,2,NA,4,NA)) )\n```\n*Interpretation: Which position(s) are the logical values `TRUE` located*\n\n\nThe output will then be an integer vector denoting the positions in which there were missing values. Applying the concepts learned in **Subsetting**, we can exclude any values which are missing. For example,\n\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1,2,NA,4,NA)\nis.na(x)\n```\n\n```{r}\n!is.na(x)\n```\n*Interpretation: For each element does this element NOT contain `NA`*\n\n```{r}\nx[!is.na(x)]\n```\n*Interpretation: Only keep the elements which DO NOT contain `NA`*\n\nIf we only want to find out if there any `NA` values, we can utilize the function `anyNA()`\n\n```{r}\nanyNA(c(1,2,NA,4,NA))\n```\n\nThe above command will output `TRUE` if there are any `NA` in the vector and `FALSE` if there is not a single missing value\n\n```{r}\nanyNA(c(1,2,3))\n```\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, a common approach to check for missing data in R, we can use `is.na()` or `anyNA()`. If we want to know the position of the missing values, we should use `is.na()`. However, if we are only concerned with whether there are any missing values or not, and not their position, then we can use `anyNA()`\n\n\n\n### Data Frames\n\nNow, working with data frames we would like to verify if there are any missing observations \nthroughout the entire dataset\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\nstudent_dat <- data.frame(\n  'StudentID' = c('12345', '23456', '23405'),\n  'Major' = c(\"math\",NA,\"biology\"),\n  'GPA' = c(3.8,3.2,NA))\n```\n\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\nstudent_dat\n```\n\n\nWhen the function `is.na()` is applied to a data frame, the output will be a matrix containing logical values. The logical values in the matrix will depend on whether there were any missing values or not in the data frame\n\n```{r}\nis.na(student_dat)\n```\n\n\nIf we wanted to find out the position(s) of the missing values for each column we will utilize the `apply()`. The basic syntax for `apply()` is \n\n`apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)`\n\n- `x`: an array or matrix\n\n- `MARGIN`:  take a value or range between 1 and 2 to define where to apply the function\n\n- `MARGIN=1`: the manipulation is performed on rows\n\n- `MARGIN=2`: the manipulation is performed on columns\n\n- `MARGIN=c(1,2)`: the manipulation is performed on rows and columns\n\n- `FUN`: tells which function to apply, according to the specified `MARGIN`\n\n\n```{r}\napply(X = is.na(student_dat), MARGIN = 2, FUN = which)\n```\n*Interpretation: From each column `MARGIN =2`, which values `(FUN = which)` from
